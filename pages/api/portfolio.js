As a key contributor, you developed the MVP, recruited and trained developers, and managed the team and budget effectively. You enhanced the tutoring service by allowing students to specify their learning needs in advance. ",

In fact, football is a low- scoring sport: the overall average number of goals scored per game at the FIFA World Cups between 1930 and 2018, is 3.08. This shows us that we cannot evaluate a teamsâ€™ performance on the number of goals scored. It is important to be able to judge how well a team did on given games: it enables the club to improve team strategies and hopefully increase number of won games.\n" +
            "Therefore, we can ask ourselves: what are appropriate metrics to use in order to get a reliable measure of the performance of a team? Can analysing the game style of a team help us explain why it might have done better/worse on a given season/game?",
